A Dungeons and Dragons (or any RP game) tool written in ruby
Still very new. There are a lot of additions and modifications to be made.

VERSION: 0.1

Currently, the best way to use it is via irb.

For Linux:
cd  into the directory with dnd.rb and run >> irb -I ./ -r 'dnd.rb'

Then create an encounter and use the class functions accordingly. An example is provided at the end of dnd.rb
